v1.1: Removed the "= 0;" on the BitVector capacity final variable:

- private final long capacity = 0;
+ private final long capacity;

---

v1.2: Fixed comment on the removeFirst method in the DoublyLinkedList class.

-     * Removes the first element if it exists, returning true if successful,
-     * and false otherwise.
+     * Finds and removes the first matching element, returning true if
+     * successful and false otherwise.
+     * Does nothing to the list if there is no such element
